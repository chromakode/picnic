# Picnic

Picnic orders random delivery food to a random location on the map and an Uber
to take you there.

Here's my experience using it for the first time:

Before using Picnic, you will need to be signed into both
[Eat24](http://eat24.com) and [Uber](https://m.uber.com). The code is very
hacky, and certainly contains bugs. It won't automatically place the orders it
generates unless you edit `bg.js`, setting `REALLY_ORDER` to `true`.

If make something like Picnic, please share it with me!
